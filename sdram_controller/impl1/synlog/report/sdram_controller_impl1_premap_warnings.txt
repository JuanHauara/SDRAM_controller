@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\hdl\sdram_controller\sdram_controller\impl1\source\sdram_controller.v":300:0:300:5|Found inferred clock sdram_controller|clk which controls 124 sequential elements including current_state[21]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
